# WIP

## Maybe it will work maybe it doesn't.

## Update: It worked, right now I am on 30 minutes run for only one class.

### At my defense, adding more classes won't affect much on the performance, because I am going to use multiprocessing and optimise it as much as I can.

#### Also, the resources of the pc are important, this program is eating RAM like a monster, you need at least 32GB of RAM to run this and a fine cpu with as many threads per core as you can.

#### Personally, I am using a 96GB RAM and 32 threads per core cpu (Ryzen 9950x), if you will use something slower, it's going to take longer (it also depends on the size of the apk).
